# Animal Trading Cards project
Animal Trading Cards project of Udacity Front-end Web-developer nano-degree. The text and the photo used in this project coming from Wikipedia the free encyclopedia. :bear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda

Download and unzip fend-animal-trading-cards-master.zip. Inside, you'll find card.html, styles.css, placeholder.png, and the design-prototype.png.
Next, open card.html and replace the placeholder image and information with your favorite animal's image and information. For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we’ll talk about how you can fix this problem using responsive images. Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.
Once you've added your favorite animal's image and information, add the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the design-prototype.png by applying the style rules in step 4. You’ll need to modify card.html to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements you want to style. Also, make sure to link to your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.
The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:
italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
no dots for the animal's list items
border around the animal's name, image, and information
border around the animal's information
spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)

__Design resembles prototype:__

 • The text is in italics for the animal’s interesting fact. 
 • The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items. 
 • The dots are removed from the animal’s list items. 
 • Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information. 
 • Uses border around animal’s information. 
 • Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information. 
 • Card width should be fixed, include the spacing around the image. 

__Custom image and text design__
- The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.
- The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.
- The image’s alternative tag is relevant to the animal used.

__Code quality__
- The HTML includes classes that are used for styling.
- Classes are given meaningful names.
- Separation of concerns, HTML from CSS, linking to stylesheet.
- HTML code does not include style elements or style attributes in the body.
- New lines of code and indentation are used for easy readability.
